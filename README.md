## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions
- The Ridge model doesn't solve the overfitting issue of the model
- The Lasso model on the other hand performs well on both train and test data
- The top 5 variables in Lasso model are - GrLivArea, OverallQual__10, OverallQual__9, GarageCars, Neighborhood_NoRidge
